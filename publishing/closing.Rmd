# Closing Procedures

You should soon be contacted by one of our managers, [Jessica Lindvall](jessica.lindvall@nbis.se) or [Henrik Lantz](henrik.lantz@nbis.se), with a request to close down the project in our internal system and for invoicing matters. If we do not hear from you within **30 days** the project will be automatically closed and invoice sent. Again, we would like to remind you about data responsibility and acknowledgements, see Data Responsibility and Acknowledgments sections.

You are naturally more than welcome to come back to us with further data analysis request at any time via [NBIS support](http://nbis.se/support/support.html).

Thank you for using NBIS and all the best for future research.
