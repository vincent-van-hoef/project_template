# Aim

This repo contains a structured set of files that - in theory - should fit most support projects from start to finish; i.e. from raw data processing over analysis to final report. The main workflow is driven by Nextflow and thus allows for the combination of different tools and methods. The hard-coded support for containeried software also secures the reproducibility of the analysis.

# Usage

Running a completed analysis is straightforward:

```
nextflow run main.nf
```
